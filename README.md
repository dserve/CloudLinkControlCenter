# Mi5 Startup NW-App

This app helps to view and sort the orders on our CloudLinkServer. It also enables you to set the status of each order.
The app is based on [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/), which is also on [github](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). 

## Getting Started

* First, download and install [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/downloads/). If necessary, add nw to your `$PATH`.

* Run ```npm install``` in the folder of this file.

* Editing and rename the file `config.js`

* Now you are ready to run this app with ```nw .``` where the `package.json` file lives.
