# Mi5 Startup NW-App

This app helps to view and sort the orders on our CloudLinkServer. It also enables you to set the status of each order.
The app is based on [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/), which is also on [github](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). 

## Getting Started

First, download and install [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/downloads/). If necessary, add nw to your `$PATH`.

Then run

```npm install```

in the folder of this file.

After editing and renaming the file `config.js`, run

```nw .```

at the same place to start this app.
